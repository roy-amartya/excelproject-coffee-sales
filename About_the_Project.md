#About my first project on GitHub
This Coffee Sales Dashboard in Excel delivers a clear, interactive view of sales performance. 
It starts by importing raw transactions into an Excel Table, ensuring dates follow a consistent format and any data entry issues are resolved. 
Small lookup tables for products and regions simplify downstream formulas, using formulas like xlookup, vlookup, and Index & Match, when some flexibility was needed.

The dashboard sheet has interactive slicers for Product, Region, and Date that allow on-the-fly filtering. PivotTables paired with PivotCharts reveal key trends at a glance.
Conditional formatting draws attention to top-selling items and potential stock gaps. At-a-glance KPI cards showcase metrics, such as Total Sales, Average Order Value, and Best Region.

Further enhancements include dropdowns via data validation, tailored chart styles, and structured tables that expand seamlessly. This exercise showcases core capabilities in data preparation, advanced Excel functions (such as XLOOKUP, VLOOKUP, INDEX & MATCH), interactive data visualisation, and automated reporting. These competencies align with corporate analyst requirements—ensuring data integrity, delivering dynamic dashboards, and enabling clear communication of insights to stakeholders.
